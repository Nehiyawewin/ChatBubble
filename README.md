# Chatbubble
A Discord bot for annoying your friends. Should be simple to setup

# Install guide

1. Download the repository, and place the files in whatever folder you want
3. Install Discordjs, and a linter. I used eslint.
4. Add a "clientId" and "token" for your bot in the config.json.
6. Add PNG files to bot/assets/chatbubble/sfw & bot/assets/chatbubble/questionable (If you have questionable images).
7. Use a program like renamer to bulk rename all of the photos to numbers, starting from 1.
8. You can now run index.js and deploycommands.js.

# In the future
Todo:
- NSFW channel permissions so questionable images cannot be sent to non NSFW channels.
- A command to target a specific friend.
- Support different file types (gif, jpg, etc)
- Get the random images a better way.

I am not going to take responsability if your bot sends nsfw content, and you are punished for it.
Additionally, I did not create this bot as a means to cyberbully people. Please chatbubble responsably.
